# Workify

**Workify** is a cool web app that I’m building to make applying for jobs way easier. It helps with a bunch of stuff like automating the application process, keeping track of the emails you get from companies, and customizing your resume so it stands out.

## Features

### 1. Automatted Application Process
Workify makes applying to jobs a breeze by:
- **Form Auto-fill**: It’ll fill out all those boring forms for you using the info you give us.
- **Automatic Submission**: Workify will even submit the applications for you, so you don’t have to waste time.
- **Manual Entry Help**: If something can’t be autofilled, Workify will help you fill it in without too much hassle.

### 2. Email Tracking and Analisys
Workify connects to your Gmail so it can track everything related to your job apps:
- **Tracking Sent Applications**: It’ll keep an eye on your sent emails and categorize them so you know what’s going on.
- **Status Updates**: Whenever a company replies, Workify updates the status for you.
- **Application Reminders**: It also sends reminders if you need to follow up on something, so you don’t miss anything important.

### 3. Resume Custimization
Workify helps you tweak your resume for each job you apply to by:
- **Dynamic Resume Builder**: Letting you edit your resume to fit the job requirements.
- **Keyword Optimazation**: Suggesting keywords to add based on the job description, so your resume doesn’t get lost in the ATS.
- **Version Control**: Managing different versions of your resume for different jobs, so you always have the right one.
